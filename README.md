# CSAA Interview Coding Exercise 

## Prerequisites:
1. Make sure you're running at least the LTS version of Node.
2. Make sure you have the latest stable Yarn.

## Setup:
1. Please clone the repo, delete the `.git/` directory, and when finished push to a new repo under your personal github account and send us the link to check it out. __PLEASE DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY!__
2. After cloning, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. To run the tests just run `jest`

## Directions:
1. This is an at-home exercise so take however long you need, we expect it to take no more than 30 minutes though.
2. Make all the tests pass without changing any of the `expect` statements.
3. Since the `expect`s are already set up you shouldn't run into any issues if you aren't familiar with Jest. If you do get stuck, please reference the Jest async testing docs or send us an email!

Enjoy!
